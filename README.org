** news release 1:
The 4th Open-Source Computational Mechanics Workshop and Summer Camp begins with the M.Sc. thesis defense of @omer. It has been 6 years since we started working on this project and we are excited to share the final outcome with the public. The event will take place on Monday, July 31, 2023, at 09:00 a.m. and will be live streamed. Please see the attached link for details.
* notes:
** to be covered next:
- Keywords: Soft tubes, arteries, dynamic instability, buckling, collapse, infarction, aenurysm, bifurcation
  (Include source papers)
